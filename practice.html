        <p>Gummy bears are a wonderful thing but some are better than others. In the words of George Orwell, "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" and that is how I feel about gummy bears, except haribo gummy bears are not equal at all, I hate them. They are chewy and hard and not gummy like and they suck.</p>
